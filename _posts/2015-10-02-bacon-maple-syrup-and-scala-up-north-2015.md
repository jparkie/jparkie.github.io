Last Friday (September 25, 2015) to the following Saturday, I attended my first technical conference Scala Up North 2015 at the Ryerson Student Centre in Toronto (while information is available at [http://scalaupnorth.com/](http://scalaupnorth.com/)).

It was fun seeing local Toronto Scala and Typesafe User Group veterans Sean Glover and Katrin Shechtman speak.

Sean's presentation about Spark Streaming was a nice introduction, and I believe it was a similar presentation he gave at the Toronto Scala and Typesafe User Group before.

Katrin's "Can DSLs be Human?" was a fun presentation. As a fan of DSLs myself, it was interesting seeing her explanation of various internal, external and hybrid DSL implementations in Scala. Her shout-out to *[DSLs in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/dsls-in-action)* was very nice; it is a really great read.

Bill Venners and Duncan DeVore - amazing people in the Scala and the Typesafe community; it was an amazing experience meeting them personally.

There were a lot of great talks as the full list can be found in this link: [http://scalaupnorth.com/speakers.html](http://scalaupnorth.com/speakers.html). My favourite talks were about types; Amanda Laucher's talk about *Types vs. Tests* blew my mind:

> "Type signature is a **Theorem**. Function definition is the **Proof**."

Overall, it was a very interesting conference; hopefully, I'll be there next year.

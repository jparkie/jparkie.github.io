Yesterday (Thursday of August 20th 2015), I gave my first presentation or lecture at the Toronto Scala and Typesafe User Group with title of my presentation being "Developing a Real-time Engine with Akka, Cassandra, and Spray": [http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Scala-Typesafe-User-Group/events/224034596/](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Scala-Typesafe-User-Group/events/224034596/).

Speaking to an audience of (maybe) 85 people was an exciting experience as I explained various things. I was extremely grateful for [Paytm Labs](http://paytmlabs.com/) for hosting the meetup and Sean Glover ([@randonom](https://twitter.com/randonom)) and Katrin Shechtman ([@katrinsh](https://twitter.com/katrinsh)) for organising the meetup and especially the later for her talk about ScalaJS.

For those who did not make my presentation, my slides are available at the following link: [http://www.slideshare.net/jparkie/developing-a-realtime-engine-with-akka-cassandra-and-spray-51902586](http://www.slideshare.net/jparkie/developing-a-realtime-engine-with-akka-cassandra-and-spray-51902586).

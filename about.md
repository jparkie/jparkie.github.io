I am a learning enthusiast; particularly, I am enthusiastic in learning about various emerging technologies.

As a hobby, I am very involved with the Android platform and its community. My various Android related open-sourced applications and libraries accumulate to a total of over **400 stars** on GitHub: [https://github.com/jparkie](https://github.com/jparkie).

Professionally, I am a Scala and Typesafe enthusiast; Play, Akka, Spark, Spray, Kamon, and Gatling - I love them all! Youâ€™ll find me at a lot of Scala and Typesafe related meetups and conferences, so if you ever want to talk about Akka or deep dive into a discussion about Reactive Streams with RxJava or Akka Streams, stay for a while!
